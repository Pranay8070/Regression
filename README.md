# Regression

## Simple Linear Regression

1.	What is simple linear regression
2.	Assumptions of simple linear regression
•	Linear relationship between X and y.
•	Normal distribution of error terms.
•	Independence of error terms.
•	Constant variance of error terms.
3.	Hypothesis testing in linear regression
•	To determine the significance of beta coefficients.
•	H0:β1=0;HA:β1≠0. 
•	T-test on the beta coefficient.
•	t score=^βiSE(^βi).
4.	Building a linear model
•	OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) method in statsmodels to fit a line.
•	Summary statistics
o	F-statistic, R-squared, coefficients and their p-values.
5.	Residual Analysis
•	Histogram of the error terms to check normality.
•	Plot of the error terms with X or y to check independence.
6.	Predictions
•	Making predictions on the test set using the 'predict()' function.
7.	Linear Regression using SKLearn
•	A second package apart from statsmodels for linear regression.
•	A more hassle-free package to just fit a line without any inferences.
